# Portfolio Project

This Repository contains projects focused on various phases of the Data Analysis process such as data cleaning, data exploration and data visualiation.

### Project-1
#### Data Exploration using SQL
* Link to project- [Project-1](https://github.com/Shrutigpt15/portfolioProject/blob/main/coviddataQuery.sql)

* Worked on COVID-19 data available freely across the internet and performed exploratory data analysis to convert chunks of numbers into summarising tables which are easily interpretable.

* Link to data- 
   Covid Deaths-[Covid-deaths](https://github.com/Shrutigpt15/portfolioProject/blob/main/covidDeaths.xlsx)
   Covid Vaccinations-[Covid-Vaccinations](https://github.com/Shrutigpt15/portfolioProject/blob/main/covidVaccinations.zip)

### Project-2
#### Dashboarding and Pivot Tables in Excel
* Link to Project- [Excel-Project](https://github.com/Shrutigpt15/portfolioProject/blob/main/Excel%20Project.xlsx)

* Guide for the Project-[Guide link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opJgMj1IUrc&ab_channel=AlexTheAnalyst)

* Summary- This small project is to demonstrate my understanding of Pivot tables and Creating small dashboards in Excel.
Not only does this project focuses on Pivot tables and slicers, It also contains some level of data cleaning to make it more interpretable.

### Project-3
#### Data cleaning in SQL
* Link to Project-[DataCleaning-Project](https://github.com/Shrutigpt15/portfolioProject/blob/main/SQLQuerycleaning.sql)
* Link to dataset- [Nashville_Housing_Data](https://github.com/Shrutigpt15/portfolioProject/blob/main/Nashville%20Housing%20Data%20for%20Data%20Cleaning.xlsx)
* Summary- This small project contains queries written in MS SQL server intended to clean the Nashville Housing dataset. I performed various operations such as populating NULL values, removing duplicates, cleaning the addresses, dropping unimportant columns to make the dataset more meaningful for further analysis.


### Project-4
#### Machine Learning in python
* Link to project-[ML_Project](https://github.com/Shrutigpt15/portfolioProject/blob/main/ML_using_python.ipynb)
* Link to dataset-[E-commerce_dataset](https://github.com/Shrutigpt15/portfolioProject/blob/main/train.csv)
* Summary- This project is built around dataset which contains star ratings, reviews, actual price , discount offer, etc. on products on E-commerce websites like Flipkart and Amazon. I started out with running exploratory data analysis on the given dataset to deal with null values and visualised the distributions of different features. Then I imputed some null values and corrected some inconsistencies in data. At last I trained my Machine learning model (XGB Regressor) and fine tuned its parameters to get good predictions.This was a part of a my first Hackathon and I ended up in top 20% of the participiants.


### Project-5
#### Creating a Relational database (Library database) with SQL and running some test queries
* Link to SQL Server Queries-[SQL_queries](https://github.com/Shrutigpt15/portfolioProject/blob/main/SQL_library_correct_v01.sql)
* Link to Description file-[Word_file](https://github.com/Shrutigpt15/portfolioProject/blob/main/Library_Database_Management_Project_wordReport.docx)
* Summary- In this small project, I created a relational database in SQL Server which is used for managing the information within a Library and across different branches too. In defining the individual attributes for an entity we have used various constraints such as PRIMARY KEY and FOREIGN KEY for establishing relationships. Then after populating the tables with Information, I wrote different queries answering questions asked from the data.
